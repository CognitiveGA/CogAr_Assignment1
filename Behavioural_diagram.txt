A possible solution for the Behavioural Diagram is the State Machine Diagram. A really brief description of it would be:
[Idle / Await Command]
    |
    | (Start Signal from Supervisor)
    ↓
[System Initialization]
    - Start sensors, comms, self-check
    |
    | (Ready to move)
    ↓
[Navigation & Mapping Active]
    - Use LiDAR, RGB-D, SONAR
    - Build & update 3D map
    - Navigate & avoid obstacles
    |
    | (Anomaly detected by sensors)
    ↓
[Victim Detection]
    - Analyze audio/video for humans
    |
    | (Victim Found)
    ↓
[Triage System]
    - Evaluate victim's condition (conscious? responsive?)
    - Prioritize rescue
    - Save location data
    |
    | (Analysis Complete)
    ↓
[Structural Risk Assessment]
    - Scan for cracks, deformations
    - Assess threat level of area
    - Mark unsafe zones on map
    |
    | (Risk evaluation complete)
    ↓
[Data Transmission & Reporting]
    - Send victim and structure reports
    - Supervisor can request details
    |
    | (Detailed data requested)
    ↓
[Detailed Scan Mode]
    - Zoom or scan specific location
    - Transmit additional sensor data
    |
    | (Supervisor acknowledges)
    ↓
← Back to [Navigation & Mapping Active] (if map incomplete)

    |
    | (Area Fully Explored)
    ↓
[Mission Success Notifier]
    - Notify supervisor of completion
    |
    | (Supervisor sends command)
    ↓
[Execute Supervisor Instruction]
    - Restart / Shutdown / Return to Base
    ↓
[Idle]

Need to add more details, like:
- Case of the Human Operator Shutting the machineor restarting the operation
- Case of the Robot finishes its work (all people assisted/ no people to assist)
- Uploading the patient condition over time
- Request from the Human Operator (go to a supervision round, ask more detail to the patient)
- Failure cases (e.g. communication)

Another solution can be done using Activity Diagram (focusing more on the control and data flow instead of the state of the robot is in).It's more valid to:
- show how the robot executes tasks in sequence or parallel.
- To model conditional logic, loops, and decision points.
- To represent parallel activities like mapping while listening for victims.

All the following step are computed if the user do not send further instruction to the robot

1) Robot Deployed
2) Initial Map Scanning
3) If the robot has seen the victims start to approach them (If there are no other instructions)
	- Already helped Victim?
		- If yes, go to step 4
		- If no
			- Triage (in Francesca's Ipad)
			- Triage ended
	- Are there any victims? If yes go to them, else continue
4) Move to the environment
	- New victim are seen?
		- If yes, go to step 3
		- Else continue
	- Already seen zone:
		- If yes: there are other zone to see?
			- If yes: 
				- Check stability
				- Repeat step 4
			- If no: continue
6) Search Ended/No more instructions 
	- If yes End -> Mission complete
	- Else continue (go to move)
