**Topic**: Post-Earthquake Scenarios for Search and Rescue

This project designs a cognitive architecture to manage a TIAGo robotic platform operating in post-earthquake environments. The robot is tasked with locating injured individuals, evaluating their medical conditions, and assessing the structural integrity of the environment.

The robot is equipped with the following sensors and devices:
- RGB-D Camera
- LiDAR
- SONAR
- Force Sensors
- Microphones
- Speakers

Primary tasks include:

- **Victim Condition Assessment**: Evaluate consciousness, responsiveness, and injury severity.
- **Structural Hazard Detection**: Identify cracks, unstable sections, and other building risks.
- **Critical Report Transmission**: Send detailed updates about victims and structures to a remote human supervisor.
- **Mission Status Notification**: Notify completion of area exploration and await further instructions.

System Architecture
