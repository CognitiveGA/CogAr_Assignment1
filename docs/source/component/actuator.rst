5. Actuator Subsystem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This subsystem is responsible for executing movement commands received from the core system by controlling the robot's motors.

- **Motor Controllers**:

  - Controls motors independently based on incoming commands.
  - Executes movement patterns like forward, backward, turning, and stopping.

  - **Subscribed Topics**:

    - ``motor_commands`` (``std_msgs/msg/String``): Motor actuation commands for movement control.

      - **Content**: JSON with:

        - ``left`` (int or float): Speed value for the left motor (positive for forward, negative for backward).
        - ``right`` (int or float): Speed value for the right motor (positive for forward, negative for backward).

  - **Published Topics**:
    - *(None currently published by Actuator Node)*

- **Motor Encoders**:

  - Measure the position, speed, and direction of a motor shaft.
  - Provided: ``Odometry``to the ``SLAM``and ``Velocity``and ``Direction``to ``Motor Controller``

**Interfaces**:

- ``Core System`` â†’ ``Actuator``: 

Sends motor control commands (via ``motor_commands`` topic).
